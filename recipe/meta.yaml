  summary: Tensor learning in Python

  description: |
    TensorLy is a Python library that aims at making tensor learning simple 
    and accessible. It allows to easily perform tensor decomposition, 
    tensor learning and tensor algebra. Its backend system allows to 
    seamlessly perform computation with NumPy, MXNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow 
    or CuPy, and run methods at scale on CPU or GPU.
